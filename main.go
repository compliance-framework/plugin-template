// Configure, and Eval are called at different times during the plugin execution lifecycle,
// and are responsible for different tasks:
//
// Configure is called on plugin startup. It is primarily used to configure a plugin for its lifetime.
// Here you should store any configurations like usernames and password required by the plugin.
//
// Eval is called once for each scheduled execution with a list of policy paths and it is responsible
// for evaluating each of these policy paths against the data it requires to evaluate those policies.
// The plugin is responsible for collecting the data it needs to evaluate the policies in the Eval
// method and then running the policies against that data.
//
// The simplest way to handle multiple policies is to do an initial lookup of all the data that may
// be required for all policies in the method, and then run the policies against that data. This,
// however, may not be the most efficient way to run policies, and you may want to optimize this
// while writing plugins to reduce the amount of data you need to collect and store in memory. It
// is the plugins responsibility to ensure that it is (reasonably) efficient in its use of
// resources.
//
// A user starts the agent, and passes the plugin and any policy bundles.
//
// The agent will:
//   - Start the plugin
//   - Call Configure() with teh required config
//   - Call Eval() with the first policy bundles (one by one, in turn),
//     so the plugin can report any violations against the configuration
