// Configure, PrepareForEval, and Eval are called at different times during the plugin execution lifecycle,
// and are responsible for different tasks:
//
// Configure is called on plugin startup. It is primarily used to configure a plugin for its lifetime.
// Here you should store any configurations like usernames and password required by the plugin.
//
// PrepareForEval is called on a scheduled execution of the plugin. Whenever the plugin is going to be run,
// PrepareForEval is called, so it can collect any data necessary for making assertions.
// Here you should run any commands, call any endpoints, or process any reports, which you want to turn into
// compliance findings and observations.
//
// Eval is called multiple times for each scheduled execution. It is responsible for running policies against the
// collected data from PrepareForEval. When a user passed multiple matching policy bundles to the agent, each of them
// will be passed to Eval in sequence. Eval will run against the collected data N times, where N is the amount
// of matching policies passed into the agent.
//
// As a complete example:
//
// The Local SSH plugin checks the local SSH configuration on a host machine.
//
// A user starts the agent, and passes the Local SSH plugin and 2 policy bundles to it.
//
// The agent will:
// * Start the plugin
// * Call Configure() with teh required config
// * Call PrepareForEval() so the plugin can collect the local SSH configuration from the machine
// * Call Eval() with the first policy bundle, so the plugin can report any violations against the configuration
// * Call Eval() with the second policy bundle, so the plugin can report any violations against the configuration
